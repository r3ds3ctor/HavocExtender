# Scheduled Task Module Architecture

## Overview
The Scheduled Task module creates persistence by scheduling a task to execute a malicious payload at specific times or events.

## Components
- **Task Creation**: Creates a new scheduled task.
- **Trigger Definition**: Defines the trigger for the task (e.g., system startup).

## Workflow
1. The module creates a new scheduled task.
2. It defines the trigger for the task.
3. It assigns the task to execute the malicious payload.

## Dependencies
- **Python**: The module is written in Python.
- **subprocess**: Used to execute system commands.

## Limitations
- Only works on Windows systems.
- Requires administrative privileges for some operations.
