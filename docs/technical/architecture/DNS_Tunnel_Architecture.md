# DNS Tunnel Module Architecture

## Overview
The DNS Tunnel module establishes covert communication using DNS queries and responses.

## Components
- **Data Encoding**: Encodes data into DNS queries.
- **Data Decoding**: Decodes data from DNS responses.

## Workflow
1. The module encodes data into a DNS query.
2. It sends the query to a DNS server.
3. It decodes the response to retrieve the data.

## Dependencies
- **Python**: The module is written in Python.
- **dnspython**: Used for DNS communication.

## Limitations
- Requires a DNS server configured to handle the tunnel.
- Limited bandwidth due to DNS protocol constraints.
