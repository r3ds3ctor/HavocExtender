# File Exfiltration Module Architecture

## Overview
The File Exfiltration module securely transfers files from a compromised system to a remote server.

## Components
- **File Encryption**: Encrypts the file before transfer.
- **Data Transfer**: Transfers the encrypted file to the remote server.

## Workflow
1. The module encrypts the file using AES encryption.
2. It transfers the encrypted file to the remote server.

## Dependencies
- **Python**: The module is written in Python.
- **requests**: Used for HTTP/HTTPS transfers.

## Limitations
- Requires a remote server to receive the file.
- Encryption key must be securely managed.
